      "project_step": "For your project step, I recommend working on a small task that combines LLMs and GenAI concepts. Here's an idea:\n\n**Task:** Implement a simple language model using Hugging Face Transformers to predict the next word in a sentence. You can use a pre-trained model like BERT or RoBERTa as a starting point.\n\n**Step:**\n\n1. Install the Hugging Face library and load a pre-trained language model.\n2. Prepare a dataset of sentences with labeled outputs (e.g., \"What is...\" -> \"your name?\"\").\n3. Implement a simple prediction algorithm using the loaded language model to predict the next word in each sentence.\n4. Evaluate your model's performance on a test set and experiment with different hyperparameters to improve its accuracy.\n\nRemember to keep your project small and manageable, focusing on learning and experimentation rather than achieving perfection. Good luck!"
